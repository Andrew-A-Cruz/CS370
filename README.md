Week 8 portfolio submission
Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

The work I did on this project was to get the the Q-Training algorithm up and running for this treasure hunt game. Computer scientists help make people's 
lives easier by utilizing the power of programming to make tasks more efficient. This matters because ultimately it makes people's lives easier which is 
better for people and better for businesses. 
I approach a problem by first making sure I understand what the problem is. Once I have a strong understanding of the problem, I then start planning out 
how I intend to solve that problem. Once I have logical pseudocode written out or a plan, I then start solving the problem. I utilize Agile methodologies by 
attempting to solve problems in pieces and solving them quickly. It is critical to make progress efficiently and to have a working product as quickly as possible.
The quality of the work cannot suffer, so it is also critical to use proper code practices like commenting. 
The ethical responsibilities developers have to the end user and the organization are to make sure the code the developer has written has their best interest
in mind. As previously stated, developers are trying to make the world better by making tasks easier. It is our obligation as develops to make sure our 
systems do this very thing. We don't want our systems to harm end users in any way and we cannot have our systems perform poorly for the organizations we
are a part of.
